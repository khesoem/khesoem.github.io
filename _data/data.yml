    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I earned my PhD in software engineering from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), Sweden, on Nov 22, 2024. My main supervisor was
      [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/) and I was also co-supervised by [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/)
      and [Fernanda Madeiral](https://fermadeiral.github.io/).
      My main research interests are program analysis, automatic program repair, explainable software bots, AI4SE, and software quality assurance.
education:
    - degree: PhD in Empirical Software Engineering
      university: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
      time: 2019 - 2024
      details: |
        In my PhD research, I am mainly focused on software patch understandability. I am trying to use different program analysis methods to
        exctract information that would be useful for learning-based and template-based techniques for patch explanation.
